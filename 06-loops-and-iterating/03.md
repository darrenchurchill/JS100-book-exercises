## Ch. 6: Loops and Iterating

### Exercise 3

The following code causes an infinite loop? Why?
```js
let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}
```

The problem with this code is the while loop's control statement. Instead of a
conditional statement, it's an assignment statement, `counter = 1`, which
returns `1`, a truthy value. This statement will never evaluate to `false`, and
the `if` statement in the loop's body will also never evaluate to `true` and
break execution out of the loop. So the loop continues infinitely.
