## Ch. 6: Loops and Iterating

### Exercise 5

The following code uses a `randomNumberBetween` function to generate a number
between its first and second arguments. It uses a `while` loop to try to
generate a number greater than `2`. Refactor the code so that you don't need to
call `randomNumberBetween` from two different locations. Don't change the
function's arguments or parameters.
```js
function randomNumberBetween(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
}

let tries = 0;
let result = randomNumberBetween(1, 6);
tries += 1;

while (result <= 2) {
  result = randomNumberBetween(1, 6);
  trues += 1;
}

console.log('It took ' + String(tries) + ' tries to get a number greater than 2');
```

Refactored:
```js
function randomNumberBetween(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
}

let tries = 0;
let result;

do {
  result = randomNumberBetween(1, 6);
  trues += 1;
} while (result <= 2);

console.log('It took ' + String(tries) + ' tries to get a number greater than 2');
```
