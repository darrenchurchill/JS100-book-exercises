## Ch. 6: Loops and Iterating

### Exercise 4

Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does the
code send to the console?
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}
```

The code will not produce an error. A for loop's three components are optional,
and in this case omitting the "next value" piece is ok, because it's included in
the loop body. The code will output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
to the console.
