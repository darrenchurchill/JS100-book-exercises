### Exercise 1

What does this code log to the console? Why?
```js
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = array1;
array1[1] = 4;
console.log(array2);
```

The code logs:
```
[1, 4, 3]
```
to the console. This is because `array1` and `array2` both point to the same
object. When the object is modified using the `array1` identifier on line 3, the
one object that exists gets modified.
