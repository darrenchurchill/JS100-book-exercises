What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling is the process of dealing with errors in a predictable and
manageable manner. The pattern usually consists of:
- `try`ing one or a few statements of code that may cause an error.
- `catch`ing errors that those statements could turn up and handling those
  errors as appropriate.
- Optionally, `finally` executing one or a few statements of code that you want
  to run regardless of whether there was an error.

Exception handling allows you to anticipate and handle errors in a program and
recover from them if it's appropriate.
