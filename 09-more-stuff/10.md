### Exercise 10

Consider this code:
```js
> let x = "5"
> x = x + 1
= "51"
```

Now, consider this code:
```js
> let y = "5"
> y++
```
What gets returned by `y++` in the second snippet, and why?

Using the increment operator, `y` is coerced implicitly into a `number`. Because
this is the postfix increment operator use, the operator returns `y`'s value
before incrementing, so the `number` `5` is returned.
