### Exercise 7

Will an error occur if you try to access an element with an index that is
greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

```js
let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?
```

No error will occur. Accessing an array with an invalid index returns
`undefined`.
