### Exercise 4

What does the following code log to the console, and why?
```js
function barCodeScanner(serial) {
  switch (serial) {
    case '123':
      console.log('Product1');
    case '113':
      console.log('Product2');
    case '142':
      console.log('Product3');
    default:
      console.log('Product not found!');
  }
}

barCodeScanner('113');
```

The code logs:
```
Product2
Product3
Product not found!
```
to the console. This is because the `switch` statement is missing `break`
statements for each case, allowing execution to fall through to the remaining
cases.
