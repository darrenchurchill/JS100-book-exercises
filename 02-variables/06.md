# Launch School Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

## Ch. 2: Variables

### Exercise 6

Will this program produce an error when run? Why or why not?
```js
const FOO = 'bar';
{
    const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);
```

This code will not produce an error. `FOO` is declared a second time inside a
new block scope which creates a separate entity.
