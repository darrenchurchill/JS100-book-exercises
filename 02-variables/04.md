## Ch. 2: Variables

### Exercise 4

What happens when you run the following code? Why?
```js
const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);
```

This results in a `TypeError` because we are trying to assign a new value to a
variable declared as a constant.
