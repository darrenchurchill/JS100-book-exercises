# Launch School Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

## Ch. 4: Functions

### Exercise 8

Without running the following code, what do you think it will output?
```js
function foo(bar, qux) {
  console.log(bar);
  console.log(qux);
}

foo(42, 3.1415, 2.718);
```

The call to `foo` has one extra argument passed in that isn't in the function
signature. That third argument will be ignored.
