## Ch. 4: Functions

### Exercise 1

What does this code log to the console? Does executing the `foo` function affect
the output? Why or why not?
```js
let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);
```

The code logs `1` to the console. Executing `foo` doesn't affect the output
because `foo` declares a new variable `bar` within its local scope.
