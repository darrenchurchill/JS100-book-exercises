## Ch. 4: Functions

### Exercise 7

Without running the following code, what do you think it will output?
```js
function foo(bar, qux) {
  console.log(bar);
  console.log(qux);
}

foo('Hello');
```

The call to `foo` is missing the second argument, which means `qux` will have a
value of `undefined` during the execution. `console.log(bar)` will log `'Hello'`
to the console. `console.log(qux)` will log `undefined` to the console.
