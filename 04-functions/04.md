## Ch. 4: Functions

### Exercise 4

What does the following code log to the console?
```js
function scream(words) {
  words = words + '!!!!';
  return;
  console.log(words);
}

scream('Yipeee');
```
The code does't log anything to the console. The function returns before
reaching the `console.log` call.
