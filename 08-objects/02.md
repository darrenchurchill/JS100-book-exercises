## Ch. 8: Objects

### Exercise 2

Which of the following values are valid keys for an object?

- `1`: valid
- `'1'`: valid
- `undefined`: valid
- `'hello world'`: valid
- `true`: valid
- `'true'`: valid

All of the values are valid keys, however, JavaScript coerces the non-string
keys values to strings. Therefore, in the list above, `1` and `'1'`, represent
the same key, and `true` and `'true'` represent the same key as well.

```js
> let myObj = {};
> my Obj[true] = 'hello';
> myObj['true'] = 'world';
> myObj[true];
= 'world'
```
