# Launch School Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

## Ch. 8: Objects

### Exercise 7

Add a `qux` property with the value `3` to `myObj` from Exercise 5.
```js
let myProtoObj = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let myObj = Object.create(myProtoObj);
myObj.qux = 3;
```

Do the following code snippets produce the same output? Why or why not?

```js
let objKeys = Object.keys(myObj);
objkeys.forEach(function(key) {
  console.log(key);
});
```

```js
for (let key in myObj) {
  console.log(key);
}
```

No, the snippets do not produce the same output. `Object.keys` only returns the
object's own keys, not inherited keys. However, a `for...in` loop iterates over
an object's own keys as well as inherited keys.

So, the first snippet logs:
```
foo
var
```
to the console.

The second snippet logs:
```
qux
foo
var
```
to the console.
