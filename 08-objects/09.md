## Ch. 8: Objects

### Exercise 9

What does the following program log to the console? Why?
```js
let foo = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
};

let qux = 'hello';

function bar(argument1, argument2) {
  argument1.a = 'hi';
  argument2 = 'hi';
}

bar(foo, qux);

console.log(foo.a);
console.log(qux);
```

The program logs:
```
hi
hello
```
to the console.

`foo` is an object, which is mutable, and is passed by reference to `bar`,
whereas `qux` is a primitive immutable string, and is passed by value to `bar`.
Because `foo` is mutable and passed by reference, its modification during the
function call persists after the function call.
